        <h1> Why did you make this? </h1>
        <p> 
          I made PooPlot to develop my skills as an engineer :). 
          I wanted to create a product that was unique, yet engineered to a high standard.
        </p>

        <h1> Umm, Eww? </h1>
        <p>
          Yep, you don't have to download my product if you don't like it. I understand it's not for everyone :). I would appreciate you downloading it to see how clean, and smooth the whole experience is though!

      <div class="questions-col">
        <h1> What is it made in? </h1>
        <p> 
          PooPlot was developed using Ionic 3. Ionic 3 is basically a hybrid mobile framework that allows you to develop once and deploy everywhere!
